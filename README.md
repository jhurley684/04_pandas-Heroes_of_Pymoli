# pandas_challenge

I chose the Pymoli project to work on.  All areas of analysis are complete.
While the dataframes and calculations are correct, due to time constraints
I opted not to attend to formatting labels for columns.  For the same reason,
some of the columns are in a differenct order than requested by the directions.

I added the data observations at the end of the jupyter notebook in markdown cells.
